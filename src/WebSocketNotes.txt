Notes on Web Socket Connection:
- A Web Socket Server is an application listening on a port of a TCP server that follows a specific protocol.

The Web Socket Handshake:
- The server must listen for incoming socket connections using a standard TCP socket
- The Handshake is the Web in WebSockets. It's the bridge from HTTP to WebSockets.
- The client has to start the WebSocket handshake process by contacting the server and requesting a WebSocket connection
    - You must know how to interpret the clients request
    - The client will send a standard HTTP request... the method must be GET

Server Handshake Response:
- When the server receives the handshake request, it should send back a special response that indicates that the protocol will be changing from HTTP
to Web Socket

Exchanging Data Frames:
- Either the client of the server can choose to send a message at an time (that's the magic of WebSockets)
- Each data frame follows the same format

Pings and Pongs:
- At any point after the handshake, wither the client or the server can choose to send a pint to the other party
- When the pin is received, the recipient must send back a pong as soon as possible
- A ping or pong is just a regular frame, but it's a control frame
